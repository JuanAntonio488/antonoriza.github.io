Hi! I'm a Computer Systems Engineer with experience in Embedded Systems and Machine Learning (ML) applications. Currently I'm doing a master degree in Finance and working as Software Engineer at Texas Instruments.

My professional experience covers the software development life cycle (SDLC) of Embedded Systems and ML applications for mexican and global markets accross different industries like Semiconductors, Tracking and Data acquisition, Home/Buildings security, FinTech, e-Health and STEM education systems.

I have been volunteer in various organizations where I have had the chance to contribute in technical and management roles across innovative and multifunctional teams with members from various countries and regions. These experiences include Wikimedia Foundation, "NodeBots" makers community, and being an ambassador "IBM Z Systems" in Mexico.

I really enjoy learn new things and solve problems in a create and innovative way through hardware and software. 

If you think my knowledge and experience can help your company or project... send me an email and lets talk!

## Hobbies & Interests

The continuos learning and exploration of technology makes me identify as a Tech Polymath or at least as a T-shaped developer. I really feel atracted by a lot of fields but If I had to choose I would say Open source Hardware and Software, Internet of Things, Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies, Quantitative Finance (specially all the stuff related with quant developers), Cloud computing and Energy harvesting. 

When Im not sat at my keyboard I try to keep fit by working out in the gym and spending some time with my pets. I really love training martial arts (taekwondo, karate and kickboxing) and dancing (salsa and rock&roll).

## This website

This website uses a Jamstack stack and has been built upon Hugo Framework. Hosting and SSL is provided by GitHubPages. You may think this website is really simple, well I was triying to keep it with a minimalistic style suscribed to a brutalist web design mentality. 

What is the purpose of this website? I asked this too... today If I want to share ideas I can just write a twitter thread, if I want to share a moment I could use instagram, youtube or tiktok, If I want to be funny I could share a simple meme and that's it. 

As developer I feel atracted to create and use my own tools and in some way have my own digital place in this space called web. Also, it helps me to develop my critical thinking skills through the reflection of different stuff that I find day by day... as someone said "becoming a scientific thinker requires practice and writing is a powerful aid to reflection". So here I will be writting blogs, essays and ideas that sometimes comes to my mind.
