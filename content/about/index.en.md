Hi! I'm a Computer Systems Engineer with experience in Embedded Systems and Machine Learning (ML) applications. Currently I'm doing a master degree in Finance with a personal focus in Quantitative Finance and working as Software Engineer at Texas Instruments.

My professional experience covers the software development life cycle (SDLC) of Embedded Systems and ML applications for mexican and global markets accross different industries like Semiconductors, Tracking and Data acquisition, Home/Buildings security, FinTech, e-Health and STEM education systems.

I have been volunteer in various organizations where I have had the chance to contribute in technical and management roles across innovative and multifunctional teams with members from various countries and regions.
