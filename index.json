I’m a Computer Systems Engineer with experience in the development life cycle of embedded systems and ML applications. My professional experience ranges from Startups to BigTechs, being part of innovative and multicultural teams designing and creating technological solutions such as products and services that meet market demands for various projects using latest technological trends like IoT, TinnyML and Cloud. I have been volunteer in different organizations where I have had the opportunity to contribute in technical and managment roles. These experiences include Wikimedia Mexico, “NodeBots MX” maker community and “IBM Z Systems”. I really love learn new things and solve problems in a creative and innovative way through hardware and software. Some side projects I do in my free time are website development, blockchain experiments (using ethereum and hyperledger networks), and podcasting (you can listen to my “Wikimentes podcast” in your favourite podcasting platform). When I’m not sat in front of my keyboard, I try to stay in shape working out at the gym and spending quality time with my pets. I love training martial arts (I’m black belt in taekwondo and karate) and dancing (salsa and rock\u0026roll). If you believe my knowledge and experience can help your company or project… reach me out via email (juanantonio@antonoriza.com) and lets talk! That’s it! Have a nice day!
